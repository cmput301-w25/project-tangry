## Project Description

This mobile application is a dynamic social platform that allows users to express their emotions by creating and sharing mood posts. Users can select an emotion, attach images, add explanations, and provide contextual information such as location and social situations. The app also supports real-time interactions by enabling comments, follow requests, and a leaderboard that highlights the most engaged users. With offline sync capabilities, users can continue posting even without an active network connection, and their updates will be automatically synchronized once connectivity is restored.

## Key Features

Creation of Mood
Users can create personalized posts by choosing from a large range of emotion from provided emoji, entering a brief description, and optionally including photos and location information. Users may also have social context, which allows for determining whether the user is in the company of others.

Social Interaction
The app supports community interaction by enabling users to follow one another, send and receive follow requests, and comment on posts. This interactive functionality provides a way to connect and converse in real time based on common feelings.

Badges and Leaderboard

A leaderboard in motion presents the top users according to their karma and number of badges (daily, silver, gold). By adding a competitive nature into the experience, this gamified feature invites users to engage proactively. Offline Syncing Support On the problem of sporadic connectivity, the application saves and synchronizes the updates locally on the device, offline, and synchronizes the server on re-establishing the connectivity.
